The density function has a center parameter $\alpha$ and a scale parameter $\delta$ . If we define the integral grid points to be ${y}_{j} = \alpha  + \delta {z}_{j},\forall 0 \leq  j \leq  {2N}$ , where ${z}_{j}$ â€™s are fixed, we will assign enough grid points around the peak of $k\left( y\right)$ whatever the model parameters and the integral will be more accurate. For other models, the density $k\left( y\right)$ is centered around 0, but it decreases at different rates when the model parameters are different. So we always use a scaled integral grid. In Table E.2, we list the relationship between the scaled grid points ${y}_{j}$ and fixed gird points $0 \leq  {z}_{0} \leq  {z}_{1} \leq  \cdots  \leq  {z}_{2N}$ used for integral. The values of ${z}_{j}$ can be found at https://github.com/weilong-columbia/pide.
